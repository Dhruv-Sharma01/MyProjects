Linear Regression Model for Nifty Stock Price Prediction
This repository contains a linear regression model implemented in Python for predicting the prices of Nifty stocks in the year 2019 using historical data from 2016 to 2018. The model leverages the relationship between various features and the stock prices to make accurate predictions.

Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluating the linear regression model consists of historical stock data of Nifty stocks from 2016 to 2018. It includes information such as opening price, closing price, highest price, lowest price, and trading volume for each trading day during this period. The dataset also contains the corresponding stock prices for the year 2019, which will be used for evaluation.
This dataset can be found in train.csv
Prerequisites

Python (version 3.7 or higher)
NumPy (version 1.20.0 or higher)
Pandas (version 1.2.0 or higher)
Scikit-learn (version 0.24.1 or higher)
